<h2>Vines Overview</h2>
<p>
  Vines contains three different components, distributed as Ruby gems:
  vines, the base chat server, vines-agent that's installed on each server, and
  vines-services, the data server with which the agents interact.
</p>

<h3>Chat Server</h3>
<p>
  The <em>vines</em> gem installs a fully standards-compliant XMPP chat server without any
  agents or services. If we're just looking for a chat server for our team
  that's easy to install and maintain, we can simply install this gem and
  ignore the other two components.
</p>
<p>
  The server is the centralized process to which the other components connect,
  so this gem is typically only installed on one machine.
</p>

<h3>Agent</h3>
<p>
  The <em>vines-agent</em> gem installs an XMPP bot that connects to the chat server and
  waits for shell commands to execute. The agent enforces access control permissions
  so chat users can only execute commands on the system as approved unix accounts.
</p>
<p>
  This gem is installed to each machine on which we'd like to run commands.
  The agent requires the services component to be installed on the chat server.
</p>

<h3>Services Component</h3>
<p>
  The <em>vines-services</em> gem installs an external XMPP component that
  connects to the chat server. This component provides the
  <a href="/services/web/">web user interface</a> and data access to
  the agents. This is typically installed wherever the vines gem is installed,
  not on each agent machine.
</p>
<p>
  While the base Vines chat server is capable to storing data in a number of
  databases, the Vines Services product requires an
  <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">Apache CouchDB</a> database. CouchDB
  provides the features needed to quickly and dynamically group servers based
  on their attributes.
